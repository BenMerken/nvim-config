# nvim-config

My personal neovim configuration.

## Installation

Clone the contents of repo into your home's `.config/nvim` folder:

```sh
# Navigate to your user's home folder
cd

# Create the folder, if it does no extist yet, and clone the repo's contents
mkdir .config/nvim
git clone git@github.com:BenMerken/nvim-config.git .
```
Make sure to have 'ripgrep' installed, as it is a required dependency for telescope's 'grep_string' functionality:

MacOS:
```sh
brew install ripgrep
```
